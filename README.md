# Predictive Modeling for Cancer Screening
With cancer being the third leading cause of death in the country and late diagnosis contributing to high mortality rates, there is an urgent need to enhance screening programs and increase participation rates.
This project aims at improving cancer screening efforts through data-driven strategies could be substantial. By identifying high-risk populations and implementing targeted interventions, we anticipate increased screening participation rates, earlier detection of cancers, and improved treatment outcomes. Ultimately, this initiative has the potential to reduce cancer-related morbidity and mortality, improve public health, and save lives in Kenya.
The project will involve collecting the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data for the year 2020, which is compiled and maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. BRFSS is a nationwide survey that collects data on health-related behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventive services among adults in the United States.
